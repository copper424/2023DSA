# 12-5 Compute the height of a binary search tree

Given a list of integers, we can build a binary search tree by inserting them one by one, then compute the height. 
The input has two lines: the first line is an integer n, the second line contains n integers, for example,

3

5 3 9

The output is the height of the binary search tree in one line. In this case, the output is

1
